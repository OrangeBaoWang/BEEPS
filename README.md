# Bi-Exponential Edge-Preserving Blur Filter Implementation In C

The smoothing is applied by the way of a bi-exponential filter, itself realized by a pair of one-tap recursions. It is therefore very fast; moreover, its computational cost is truly independent of the amount of smoothing. Meanwhile, the preservation of edges is obtained by a range filter akin to the range filter found in a bilateral filter. More technical details are available [here](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/preprints/thevenaz1201p.html).
